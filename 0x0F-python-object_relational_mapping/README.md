# 0x0F. Python - Object-relational mapping


Foobar is a Python library for dealing with word pluralization.

## Background Context
In this project, you will link two amazing worlds: Databases and Python!

In the first part, you will use the module MySQLdb to connect to a MySQL database and execute your SQL queries.

In the second part, you will use the module SQLAlchemy (don’t ask me how to pronounce it…) an Object Relational Mapper (ORM).

The biggest difference is: no more SQL queries! Indeed, the purpose of an ORM is to abstract the storage to the usage. With an ORM, your biggest concern will be “What can I do with my objects” and not “How this object is stored? where? when?”. You won’t write any SQL queries only Python code. Last thing, your code won’t be “storage type” dependent. You will be able to change your storage easily without re-writing your entire project.

**Without ORM:**
```python

conn = MySQLdb.connect(host="localhost", port=3306, user="root", passwd="root", db="my_db", charset="utf8")
cur = conn.cursor()
cur.execute("SELECT * FROM states ORDER BY id ASC") # HERE I have to know SQL to grab all states in my database
query_rows = cur.fetchall()
for row in query_rows:
    print(row)
cur.close()
conn.close()
```
**With an ORM:**
```python

engine = create_engine('mysql+mysqldb://{}:{}@localhost/{}'.format("root", "root", "my_db"), pool_pre_ping=True)
Base.metadata.create_all(engine)

session = Session(engine)
for state in session.query(State).order_by(State.id).all(): # HERE: no SQL query, only objects!
    print("{}: {}".format(state.id, state.name))
session.close()
```
Do you see the difference? Cool, right?

The biggest difficulty with ORM is: The syntax!

Indeed, all of them have the same type of syntax, but not always. Please read tutorials and don’t read the entire documentation before starting, just jump on it if you don’t get something.

# More info
Install ```MySQLdb``` module version ```1.3.x```
For installing MySQLdb, you need to have MySQL installed: 
-> GOOGLE IT: How to install MySQL 5.7 in Ubuntu 14.04

```unix
$ sudo apt-get install python3-dev
$ sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev
$ sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev
$ sudo pip3 install mysqlclient==1.3.10
...
$ python3
>>> import MySQLdb
>>> MySQLdb.__version__ 
'1.3.10'
```
Install ```SQLAlchemy``` module version ```1.2.x```
```unix

$ pip3 install SQLAlchemy==1.2.5
...
$ python3
>>> import sqlalchemy
>>> sqlalchemy.__version__ 
'1.2.5'
```
Also, you can have this warning message:

```unix
/usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages/sqlalchemy/engine/default.py:552: Warning: (1681, "'@@SESSION.GTID_EXECUTED' is deprecated and will be re
moved in a future release.")                                                                                                                    
  cursor.execute(statement, parameters)  
```
You can ignore it.
